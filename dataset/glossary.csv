Originally a term describing any sale in which the seller sells his merchandise for more than the price at which he acquired it, the term ‘murabaha’ is now used in contemporary Islamic finance to describe a financing scheme in which a financial institution, usually a bank, agrees to purchase merchandise for a client provided that the client promises to purchase it from the financial institution at an agreed upon mark-up.

,Bay Bil Wafa,بيع بالوفاء,Redemption sale,Sale with the right of the seller to repurchase the property by refunding the purchase price. Most legal schools hold such a sale to be impermissible as the intention of the seller is not to relinquish ownership but rather to use the alleged sale as a means to monetise an asset through collusion with the buyer.
,Bay Muajjal,بيع مؤجل,Deferred payment sale,A sale in which payment is delayed and delivery of the contracted goods is immediate. This financing technique has been adopted by Islamic banks and combined with the murabaha contract to form murabaha muajjal. This contract allows the seller to earn a profit margin on his purchase price and allows the buyer to pay the price of the commodity at a future date in a lump sum or in instalments. The seller has to expressly mention the cost of the commodity and the margin of profit is mutually agreed.
